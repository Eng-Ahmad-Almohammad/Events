# Events
## TRADITIONAL DOM EVENT HANDLERS 
### All modern browsers understand this way of creating an event handler, but you can only attach one function to each event handler.

## EVENT LISTENERS 
### Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events. They can deal with more than one function at a time but they are not supported in older browsers.

## THE EVENT OBJECT 
### When an event occurs, the event object tells you information about the event, and the element it happened upon.
